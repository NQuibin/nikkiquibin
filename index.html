                    I believe that there's always something new to learn,
                    and one should be hungry for self improvement and
                    mastering their craft.

                            Loopio is a knowledge management and RFP response
                            SaaS company. My team works on User Engagement,
                            Reporting, and Integrations for the platform. I
                            helped build better user interaction, allow admins
                            to track the performance of their proposals and
                            knowledge content, and recently rolled out our Slack
                            and Chrome Extension integration. Working for this
                            company has taught me many things, most importantly
                            to keep mastering my craft.

                            During my year here, I led the development of
                            business intelligence tools and macros for auditors,
                            built with Microsoft's legendary Visual Basic
                            language. Although I was the only person in my team
                            with programming skills, the amazing people here
                            helped me understand what they expect the tools
                            should accomplish. Working here has improved my
                            collaboration and people skills to build an
                            outstanding product.

                            passionate with their work and motivated me to build
                            software to empower humanity. My time here was spent
                            developing a Java application to test a soldier's
                            vigilance from a bird's eye view, and present the
                            data recorded in a meaningful manner. This was a
                            wonderful opportunity to learn what goes into
                            verifying and validating a research hypothesis.

                            Attending the Scarborough campus, UofT has
                            presented me with diverse opportunities and
                            community. It was a lot of hard work with many
                            obstacles during my four years here but it was
                            rewarding, with many brilliant people met along the
                            way. The classes and professors pushed me to expand
                            my horizons and challenged me to do my best. UofT
                            has tought me concepts beyond just learning how to
                            code, such as the importance of algorithms, data
                            structures, and software development methodologies
                            like Agile. Overall, university is an experience
                            that I would recommend anyone because it builds
                            character and self growth.
