                        Loopio is a knowledge management and RFP response SaaS company.
                        My team works on User Engagement, Reporting, and Integrations
                        for the platform. I helped build better user interaction, allow
                        admins to track the performance of their proposals and knowledge
                        content, and recently rolled out our Slack and Chrome Extension
                        integration. Working for this company has taught me many things,
                        most importantly to keep mastering my craft.

                    <p>
                        During my year here, I led the development of business intelligence
                        tools and macros for auditors, built with Microsoft's legendary
                        Visual Basic language. Although I was the only person in my team
                        with programming skills, the amazing people here helped me understand
                        what they expect the tools should accomplish. Working here has
                        improved my collaboration and people skills to build an outstanding
                        product.

                    <p>
                        I've got to work with an amazing team here who are passionate with
                        their work and motivated me to build software to empower humanity.
                        My time here was spent developing a Java application to test a soldier's
                        vigilance from a bird's eye view, and present the data recorded in a
                        meaningful manner. This was a wonderful opportunity to learn what goes
                        into verifying and validating a research hypothesis.
