                        Loopio is a knowledge management and RFP response SaaS company.
                        My team works on User Engagement, Reporting, and Integrations
                        for the platform. I helped build better user interaction, allow
                        admins to track the performance of their proposals and knowledge
                        content, and recently rolled out our Slack and Chrome Extension
                        integration. Working for this company has taught me many things,
                        most importantly to keep mastering my craft.

                        During my year here, I led the development of business intelligence
                        tools and macros for auditors, built with Microsoft's legendary
                        Visual Basic language. Although I was the only person in my team
                        with programming skills, the amazing people here helped me understand
                        what they expect the tools should accomplish. Working here has
                        improved my collaboration and people skills to build an outstanding
                        product.

                        their work and motivated me to build software to empower humanity.
                        My time here was spent developing a Java application to test a soldier's
                        vigilance from a bird's eye view, and present the data recorded in a
                        meaningful manner. This was a wonderful opportunity to learn what goes
                        into verifying and validating a research hypothesis.

                        Specifically the Scarborough campus, UofT has presented me with diverse
                        opportunities and community. It was a lot of hard work with many obstacles
                        during my four years here but it was rewarding, with many brilliant people
                        met along the way. The classes and professors pushed me to expand my horizons
                        and challenged me to do my best. UofT has tought me concepts beyond just
                        learning how to code, such as the importance of algorithms, data structures,
                        and software development methodologies like Agile. Overall, university is
                        an experience that I would recommend anyone because it builds character and
                        self growth.
